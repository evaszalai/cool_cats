# Cats for pets


## Story

It's time to enhance the Online Shop, an online eCommerce web-application with Java.
Where users can not only browse products, add them into a Shopping Cart,
checkout items and make payments. But also can log in and see the abandoned shopping cart or order history.

> Did you know that the very first product on eBay was a broken laser pointer?
> If you don't believe, check their history: [eBay history](https://www.ebayinc.com/company/our-history/)

      - In the ```/src/main/resources/connection.properties``` file complete the ```user``` and ```password``` fields with your database credentials
      - Replace ```dao``` field from ```memory``` to ```jdbc```
